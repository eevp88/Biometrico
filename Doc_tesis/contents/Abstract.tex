\vspace{0.5cm}

Today, the technological devices are increasing and they are being incorporated in daily life. The technological devices give to us an unusual degree of connectivity, for example: tablets, smartphones, or even everyday things, such as a refrigerator. In this context, the humanity begins to live with a network of interconnected devices that is known as the ``Internet of Things'', which will be the next technological revolution, bringing new opportunities and challenges for the users, business and society. In this scenario, the objective of this project is to communicate devices through 6LoWPAN, a standard based on the IPv6 protocol over low-power and lossy networks to support the Internet of Things, using open hardware platforms and emphasizing the singularities of embedded systems, such as a limited number of operations, low power consumption and low band width capability. In addition, the prototype uses the standard 6LoWPAN in a network environment that brings the Internet of Things to a Bridge Management System for optimizing maintenance of structures.\\
